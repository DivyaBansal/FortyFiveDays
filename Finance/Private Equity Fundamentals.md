**Making Money the Old-Fashioned Way With Debt**

When a private equity firm tries to extract value quickly by making the acquired company to take on more debt to accelerate their returns through a dividend recapitalization, which funds a dividend distribution to the private equity owners with borrowed money. 

This way they saddle the portfolio company with extra debt.

The increased debt presumably lowers the company's valuation when it is sold again, 
while lenders must agree with the owners that the company will be able to manage the resulting debt load.
