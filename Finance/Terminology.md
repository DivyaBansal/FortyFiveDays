- Private equity is investment that is organized as limited partnerships.
- It can buy and restructure companies that are not publicly traded.
- Private equity consists of capital that is not listed on a public exchange.
- Private equity is composed of funds and investors that directly invest in private companies, or that engage in buyouts of public companies, resulting in the delisting of public equity.

- Investment in private equity is direct investment and investors seek out a private equity firm to invest with them.
- Invest in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs because they are built to track the performance of private equity firms.

Private equity is often grouped with venture capital and hedge funds as an alternative investment.
Investors in this asset class are usually required to commit significant capital for years,
which is why access to such investments is limited to institutions and individuals with high net worth.

In contrast with venture capital, most private equity firms and funds invest in mature companies rather than startups. They manage their portfolio companies to increase their worth or to extract value before exiting the investment years later.
